[Discover Olympic History](https://summer-olympics-data-analysis.streamlit.app/)

## Overview
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of Olympic Games data, spanning from 1896 to 2016. It covers over 270,000 athletes and offers insights into medal distributions, athlete demographics, and the impact of host cities, with a focus on gender participation trends and the evolution of Olympic sports.

## Features
- Comprehensive analysis of 120 years of Olympic data
- Interactive dashboard built with Streamlit
- Dynamic visualizations using Plotly and Seaborn
- Insights into medal distributions, athlete demographics, and historical trends
- Performance analysis of top athletes and sports
- Impact analysis of host cities on Olympic outcomes

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas for data manipulation and analysis
- NumPy for numerical operations
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for static visualizations
- Plotly for interactive visualizations
- Streamlit for building the web application
- Scipy for scientific computations

## Installation and Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/olympics-analysis.git
   cd olympics-analysis
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
